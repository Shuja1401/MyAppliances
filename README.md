### MyAppliances
_A one-stop shop for all the items in your house!_

## Problem
The kitchen chimney in your house needs cleaning. You make a call to the service centre, and the guy informs you that there are a couple of parts requiring replacement. You dutifully pay for those parts and things are back to normal. 

Six months down the line, the chimney starts making a "hissing" noise. You again make a call to the service centre, and the guy once again informs you that the parts needs replacement. It occurs to you that something similar happened six months ago. Now, since there is no record/memory of the service performed on your chimney six months ago, the only option is to trust the words of the repairman! 

You comply. Make a note of the service in a decrepit diary. And move on.

Now, Murphy's Law states: A decrepit diary containing trivial-yet-important information will be visible to you every day, except when you need it.

In a normal Indian household, there are at least a dozen of gadgets, appliances, machines and devices. Keeping a track of warranty status, service schedule and repair work of each device is a daunting task. No matter, how hard you try to organize these details, you either end up missing a service date, or paying extra for repair even when your device was in warranty.

## Solution:
MyAppliances app helps you organize all your devices in one place. The lighweight app will help you track warranty status, and service schedule of your items. It will also help you record the details of the repair work, which you can later use to track the health of items in your house. It also maintains a database of service centres for your devices, helping you to reach out to the repair guy when required.

## Future versions will include 
Ability to scan and read bill receipts and stickers to avoid manually entering the details of the device.
A dashboard to show you monitor the health of your devices based.
